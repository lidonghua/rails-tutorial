# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

It's just an exercise while reading the great Rails Tutorial.

## Major differences

- Use latest gems when possible.
- Use bootstrap 3 to get a more modern-look.
- Use `kaminari` for pagination instead of `will_paginate`.

## Original information

This is the sample application for
the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).
